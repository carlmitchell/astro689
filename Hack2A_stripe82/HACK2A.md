# Comparing SDSS standard star catalog to SDSS catalog cross-matched with 2MASS

Goal:  
* Get some experience downloading and using AstroML example datasets.

Tasks:  
* Download the SDSS Stripe82 Standard Star Catalog
* Download the same with the 2MASS correlation flag set to True
* Make r-i vs. g-r color-color plots for both catalogs
* Discuss differences between these

Results:  
* Plotted both diagrams separately, as well as a side-by-side and overlayed version for direct comparison.
* The cross-matched data have a much tighter "main sequence"
* There's a "cloud" of stars towards the lower left that disappears in the cross-matched sample
